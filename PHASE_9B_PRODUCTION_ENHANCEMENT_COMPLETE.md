  - Automatic scaling calculations (scalingFactor = targetPortions / recipe.servingSize)
  - Ingredient quantity scaling with cost estimation
  - Production plan integration
  - Transaction-safe batch creation
  - Real-time cost calculation per portion

### 2. Production Batch Management System ‚úÖ
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `/api/production/batches` - CRUD operations with filtering

  - Comprehensive batch tracking (planned ‚Üí in-progress ‚Üí completed)
  - Cost analysis (estimated vs actual)
  - Efficiency metrics calculation
  - Status management with business logic validation

### 3. Frontend Production Interface ‚úÖ

  - `/dashboard/production/batches` - Main batch listing with filters
  - `/dashboard/production/batches/from-recipe` - Recipe-to-batch conversion
  - `/dashboard/production/batches/[id]` - Detailed batch management
  - `/dashboard/production/batches/new` - Manual batch creation

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Models Integrated
```prisma
ProductionBatch {
  - Recipe relationship for scaling
  - ProductionPlan relationship  
  - Cost tracking (estimated + actual)
  - Status workflow management
  - Efficiency metrics
}

Recipe {
  - Ingredients with quantities
  - Serving size for scaling
  - Cost calculation base
  - Production time estimates
}

ProductionPlan {
  - Multi-batch coordination
  - Timeline management
  - Resource planning
}
```

### Key Features Implemented

#### 1. Recipe Scaling Algorithm
```typescript
const scalingFactor = targetPortions / recipe.servingSize;
const scaledQuantity = ingredient.quantity * scalingFactor;
const estimatedCost = scaledQuantity * ingredient.item.unitPrice;
```

#### 2. Production Efficiency Tracking
```typescript
const efficiency = (actualQuantity / targetQuantity) * 100;
const costEfficiency = ((estimatedCost - actualCost) / estimatedCost) * 100;
```

#### 3. Cost Analysis System
- Estimated cost calculation from recipe ingredients
- Actual cost tracking during production
- Variance analysis and cost per portion metrics
- Real-time budget monitoring

## üìä Database Utilization Progress

### Before Phase 9B: 45%
- User Management, School Management, Recipe Management
- Distribution System, Quality Management
- Financial Reporting, Monitoring & Analytics

### After Phase 9B: 60% ‚úÖ
**Added Models:**
- ProductionBatch (full utilization)
- ProductionPlan (enhanced utilization)  
- Recipe-ProductionBatch relationships
- Cost tracking integrations

**Improvement:** +15% database utilization achieved
